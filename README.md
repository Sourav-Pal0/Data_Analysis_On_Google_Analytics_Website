* **Master the referral maze:** Explore the top paths visitors take to reach your site (/analytics/web/), helping you refine your internal linking strategy and improve user experience.
* **Tech trends revealed:** Analyze the dominant browsers (Chrome reigns supreme) and devices your audience uses, ensuring your website delivers a seamless experience across platforms.
